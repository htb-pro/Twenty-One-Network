may introduce the topic, pose questions, and facilitate transitions between panelists.<br>

experiences, and opinions on the topic. This diversity of perspectives enriches the discusion and 
offers a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.<br>

one another's comments, challenging ideas, and offering counterarguments. This encourages a 
deeper exploration of the topic and promotes critical thinking.<br>
